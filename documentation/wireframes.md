# **Wireframes**

The following designs were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), which is a fantastic, easy-to-use design tool to help initiate website design.

The following designs were mostly met with minor exceptions, those minor exceptions being oddities such as an extra container background for the principal page, an size field with a Font Awesome icon alongside the already made bedroom and bathroom icons, the eventual order of input fields in the form creation page and the additional of an [Accordion](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/accordion/) component to the search filter component.

Wireframes were not created for every single page, rather for the main pages and then further designs for other pages were naturally implemented and consistent, as components were passed over and modified (such as the edit form, user profile edit form etc.)
